**Step 1: Create a GitHub account:** 


**Step 2: Create a new repository:** 
A repository is a location or container where anything is kept; in this example, we're using Git to keep track of our code.


**Step 3: Create a file:** 
For the time being, create a new file from the terminal and disregard the rest. On your computer, launch the Terminal software. Alternatively, on Windows, you may use cmd to navigate to the organizer where you saved the repo.


**Step 4: Make a commit:**
So far, you've created a document and told Git about it, and now is the perfect time to submit it. The act of submitting might be viewed as a triumph. Each time you finish a task, make a git commit to save that version of your record so you can go back and examine what it looked like then. When you make a change to your record, you create a new version of it, one that is not identical to the previous one.

**Step 5: Connect your GitHub repo with your computer:**
Now you can use the command to connect your machine to GitHub:

git configuration

git config –-global user.name "[name]" git config –-global user.name "[name]"

git config –-global user.email "[email address]" git config –-global user.email "[email address]"

This command sets the author name and email address for your commits, accordingly.


**GIT & GitHub:**
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that can manage everything from tiny to extremely big projects with ease. When people and teams engage on projects together, a version control system, or VCS, monitors the history of modifications. It's widely used in both open source and commercial software development, and it has a lot of advantages for teams.

GitHub is a Git hosting repository that gives developers the tools they need to ship better work via command line tools, issues (threaded conversations), and pull requests. The whole collection of files and folders connected with a project, as well as the revision history of each file.
